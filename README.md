# Java Weekly Assignments – Feminna G

This repository contains my **week-wise Java programming assignments** completed as part of the academic coursework at **Rajalakshmi Engineering College**.  
Each week includes hands-on programs demonstrating key Java concepts—ranging from basic syntax and OOP principles to advanced topics like exception handling, collections, file handling, multithreading, and JDBC-based database operations.  

The structure of the repository follows a clean, organized layout, allowing easy navigation through different weekly assignments and corresponding PDF submissions.
